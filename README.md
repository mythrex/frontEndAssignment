## Webpack
A bundler for javascript and friends. Packs many modules into a few bundled assets. Code Splitting allows to load parts for the application on demand. Through "loaders," modules can be CommonJs, AMD, ES6 modules, CSS, Images, JSON, Coffeescript, LESS, ... and your custom stuff. 
## How to use?
Install Packages
```
npm install
```
then, run for dev
```
npm run dev
```
the files will be served on **localhost:8080**

for production run 
```
npm run prod
```
and copy all the contents from /dist folder to your server.

### Why to use it?
It minifies js,css and images. It optimizes the js and html page for better *page-insights* score.

### File Structure
All the work is done in __src__ folder.
1. All the css are in **/src/css**.
2. All the js are in **/src/js**.
3. All the bundles are required in **app.js**
4. Index.ejs is the home page.

> You can add mode pages but you will have to configure _webpack.config.js_.

### Changing the title
Just replace the __Webpack__ in this line in package.json
```
template: 'ejs-simple-loader?title=Webpack&activePage=home!./src/index.ejs',
```
> It will probably be line no 49.
> You need to suppy html-webpack-plugin template option a title 


##### Have fun
